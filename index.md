# About Me

<!--<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic">-->
<br>

Here is **Evie Wei**. Welcome to my personal website!<br>

I am an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology in Hangzhou Dianzi University. Recently, I have been to the University of California, Irvine as an exchange student.

I am working on model optimization in a project 'Data Visualization and Prediction of Carbon Emission' led by [Professor Shi](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/sxy2/main.htm). Our latest achievements have been written and accepted by [ICCGE 2024](https://iccge.org/). I also spent a great summer at New York University with [Professor Gaffney](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/faculty-directory/20072-christopher-t-gaffney.html#about20072) for data visualization. [Analysys](https://www.analysys.cn/) and [JD Logistics](https://www.jdl.com/en/profile) are two companies I used to work as an intern. I was a business analyst in Analysys and a member of the operation analysis group in the Supply Chain Shanghai Integrated Support Department.<br>
