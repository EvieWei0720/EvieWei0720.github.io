# About Me

<!--<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic">-->
<br>

Here is **Evie Wei**. Welcome to my website!<br>

I am an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology in Hangzhou Dianzi University. Recently, I went to the University of California, Irvine as an exchange student and got a certificate in 'Data Analytics for Business'.

Now, I am working in [Ligentia USA, Inc.](https://ligentia.com/) as a Business Data Analyst intern in the North American Professional Services team. My job is to develop dashboards and perform data ETL from various sources into the BI platform. [Analysys](https://www.analysys.cn/) and [JD Logistics](https://www.jdl.com/en/profile) are two companies I used to work in. I was a business analyst intern at Analysys and a temporary member of the operation analysis group in the Supply Chain Shanghai Integrated Support Department. For my research experience, my teammates and I finished a project 'Data Visualization and Prediction of Carbon Emission' led by [Professor Shi](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/sxy2/main.htm). [Our achievements](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-1812-5_13) have been written and published. I also spent a great summer at New York University with [Professor Gaffney](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/faculty-directory/20072-christopher-t-gaffney.html#about20072) for data visualization.<br>
