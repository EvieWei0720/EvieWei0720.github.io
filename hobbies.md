&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music is my longest and biggest hobby. <br>

As a child, I learned to play the **piano** and thus became interested in music. When I went to high school, I met my friends and we formed a **band**. We had some small live performances together. After graduation, I learned **classical guitar**, just playing simple songs.

After I enrolled in university, I joined a music club and learned **post-production**, including recording and sound modification. But I prefer **live stage performances**, so I spend most of my free time organizing parties. I was so grateful that our student union gave me a chance to follow my passion. To offer high-quality performances, I watched lots of stage performances to draw inspiration. Currently, my love is **musical**. 'Phantom of the Opera' is my favorite! If you are interested in musical, we can go to the theater together!

<p>I am a huge fan of LEGO! I can calm myself down and release my stress while focusing on LEGO. I made different kinds of LEGO every year. Since my family moved several times, many models I built before are missing. Those are current works I made with my little brother.</p>
