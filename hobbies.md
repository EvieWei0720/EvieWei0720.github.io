<br>Music is my longest and biggest hobby. <br>
As a child, I learned to play the piano and thus became interested in music. When I went to high school, I met my friends and we formed a band. We had some small live performances together. <br>
After I enrolled in university, I joined a music club and learned post-production, including recording and sound modification. But I prefer live stage performances, so I spend most of my free time organizing parties. I was so grateful that our students' union gave me a chance to follow my passion. To offer high-quality performances, I watched lots of stage performances to draw inspiration. Currently, I love to watch musicals. 'Phantom of the Opera' is my favorite! If you are interested in musicals, we can go to the theater together!

## Workshop

<br>There must be something truly magical about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.
