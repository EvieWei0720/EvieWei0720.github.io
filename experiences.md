## Research Projects

- **Data Visualization and Prediction of Carbon Emission**<br>Led by [Prof. Shi](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/sxy2/main.htm)<br>This project aims to deal with the lack of fine-grained data prediction and deliver the urgency of reducing carbon emission via visualization.<br>I am responsible for data collection & preparation, model optimization and paper writing. Our paper tackles the problem of geographically accurate predictions by using fine-grained data, and preliminary optimizes existing methods by adapting deep learning models, such as Autoformer with time series.<br>

- **Virtual Fit Project**<br>Supervised by [Prof. Yu](https://computer.hdu.edu.cn/2021/1217/c6770a140242/page.htm) and [Prof. Gao](https://hz.xidian.edu.cn/info/1286/5200.htm)<br>Make online shopping faster! We focused on the effect of virtual fitting with improving the identification effect of clothing area.<br>I was the project manager in charge of time management and presenting the achievements regularly. Also, I did literature collection and Cocosnet algorithm implementation, assisting with web design.<br>

- **Data Visualization — Dessert Shops in New York Northern Soho**<br>Supervised by [Prof. Gaffney](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/faculty-directory/20072-christopher-t-gaffney.html#about20072)<br>A simple field research and data processing skills were required.<br>I interviewed dessert shops and did data cleaning, ending up with two Tableau maps, one hand-drawn timetable and a flourish chart.<br>

- **Lip2Wav Project**<br>Supervised by [Prof. Yu](https://computer.hdu.edu.cn/2021/1217/c6770a140242/page.htm)<br>We were determined to improve the localization of foreign language videos. The corresponding mouth shape with local language is our research orientation.<br>I did the front-end interface implementation.<br>

- **Human Motion Recognition Based on MLP Classifier**<br>Paper for the 2022 Certificate Authority Cup International mathematical contest in modeling<br>I did the feature recognition and classification based on MLP Classifier, including model assessment and optimization(overfitting problem).<br>

- **Farewell to Light Pollution**<br>Paper for the 2023 Interdisciplinary Contest In Modeling<br>I created the LISA model, combining principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), CRITIC algorithm and analytic hierarchy process (AHP).<br>

- **Strive for the Top Student in Carbon Neutrality**<br>Paper for The concentrated training model of HDU for the MCM/ICM Contest of 2023<br>I was responsible for time series analysis, including the evaluation and comparison of relevant algorithms.<br>
