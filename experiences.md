## Industry Experiences

- **Business Data Analyst Intern**<br>Company: [Ligentia](https://ligentia.com/)<br>I developed several **PowerBI dashboards** for both internal operations and customer-facing purposes, enhancing data accessibility and decision-making. I also explored the integration of **Python-generated custom visuals** in Power BI to increase flexibility and visual expressiveness. Additionally, I collaborated with my mentor to identify the optimal energy consumption-to-output ratio for over 50 machines by applying **machine learning models** to improve operational efficiency.<br>

- **Business Analyst Intern**<br>Company: [Analysys](https://www.analysys.cn/)<br>I investigated and surveyed **AI Agent Development Platforms**, improving an AI product database. A **comparative analysis** table of Agent Development Platforms and enterprise competitiveness was produced. I summarized my results in a brief **industry analysis**.<br>

- **Personal Assistant - Data Analyst**<br>Company: [JD Logistics](https://www.jdl.com/en/profile)<br>I was a member of the operation analysis group in the Supply Chain Shanghai Integrated Support Department, assisting in checking the wage data using **Excel**.<br>

## Projects

- **Data Visualization and Prediction of Carbon Emission**<br>Led by [Prof. Shi](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/sxy2/main.htm)<br>This project aims to deal with the lack of fine-grained data prediction and deliver the urgency of reducing carbon emission via visualization.<br>I am responsible for **EDA**, including data collection & preparation, model optimization, and paper writing. Our paper tackles the problem of geographically accurate predictions by using fine-grained data, and preliminary optimizes existing methods by adapting **machine learning and deep learning models**, such as **Autoformer** with time series.<br>

- [**Movie Reference & Profit Prediction System**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Evie25/recommendation_system)<br>A capstone project in Data Analytics for Business courses<br>Background: We are a data-driven consulting company to provide suggestions for filmmakers. They can use our system to find movies with similar idea and check their profit. Also, if they are satisfied with this market search, they can enter detailed information about their movie and the system can predict the exact profit.<br>I am the team leader for this project. My role is a data scientist for **full-stack designing and implementation**.<br>

- [**Click-Through Rate Prediction Based on Wide and Deep Model**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Evie25/CTR_Prediction)<br>Online Project<br>A demo of a CTR prediction system using a **Wide & Deep model**, featuring UI-based hyperparameter tuning.<br>

- **Virtual Fit Project**<br>Supervised by [Prof. Yu](https://computer.hdu.edu.cn/2021/1217/c6770a140242/page.htm) and [Prof. Gao](https://hz.xidian.edu.cn/info/1286/5200.htm)<br>Make online shopping faster! We focused on the effect of virtual fitting with improving the identification effect of clothing area.<br>I was the project manager in charge of time management and presenting the achievements regularly. Also, I did literature collection and **Cocosnet algorithm** implementation, assisting with web design.<br>

- **Data Visualization — Dessert Shops in New York Northern Soho**<br>Supervised by [Prof. Gaffney](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/faculty-directory/20072-christopher-t-gaffney.html#about20072)<br>Simple field research and data processing skills were required.<br>I **interviewed** dessert shops and did **data cleaning**, ending up with **two Tableau maps**, one hand-drawn timetable and a flourish chart.<br>

- **Lip2Wav Project**<br>Supervised by [Prof. Yu](https://computer.hdu.edu.cn/2021/1217/c6770a140242/page.htm)<br>We were determined to improve the translation quality of foreign language videos. The corresponding mouth shape with the local language is our research orientation.<br>I did the **front-end interface implementation**.<br>

- **Human Motion Recognition Based on MLP Classifier**<br>Paper for the 2022 Certificate Authority Cup International mathematical contest in modeling<br>I did the **feature recognition and classification** based on the **MLP Classifier**, including **model assessment** and **optimization(overfitting problem)**.<br>

- **Farewell to Light Pollution**<br>Paper for the 2023 Interdisciplinary Contest In Modeling<br>I created the LISA model, combining **principal component analysis (PCA)**, **hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA)**, **CRITIC algorithm**, and **analytic hierarchy process (AHP)**.<br>

- **Strive for the Top Student in Carbon Neutrality**<br>Paper for The concentrated training model of HDU for the MCM/ICM Contest of 2023<br>I was responsible for **time series analysis**, including the evaluation and comparison of relevant algorithms.<br>
