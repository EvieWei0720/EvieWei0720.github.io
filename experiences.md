## Research Projects

- **Data Visualization and Prediction of Carbon Emission**<br>Led by Prof. Shi<br>I am responsible for data collection & preparation, model optimization and paper writing.<br>Our paper tackles the problem of geographically accurate predictions by using fine-grained data, and preliminary optimizes existing methods by adapting deep learning models, such as Autoformer with time series.<br>

- **Data Visualization — Dessert Shops in New York Northern Soho**<br>Guided by Prof. Gaffney<br>A simple field research and data processing skills were required. I interviewed dessert shops and did data cleaning, ending up with two Tableau maps, one hand-drawn timetable and a flourish chart.<br>

- **Virtual Fit Project**<br>Guided by Prof. Yu and Prof. Gao<br>I was the project manager in charge of time management and presenting the achievements regularly. Also, I did literature collection and Cocosnet algorithm implementation, assisting with web design.<br>

- **Human Motion Recognition Based on MLP Classifier**<br>Paper for the 2022 Certificate Authority Cup International mathematical contest in modeling<br>I did the feature recognition and classification based on MLP Classifier, including model assessment and optimization(overfitting problem).<br>

- **Farewell to Light Pollution**<br>Paper for the 2023 Interdisciplinary Contest In Modeling<br>I created the LISA model, combining principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), CRITIC algorithm and analytic hierarchy process (AHP).<br>

- **Strive for the Top Student in Carbon Neutrality**<br>Paper for The concentrated training model of HDU for the MCM/ICM Contest of 2023<br>I was responsible for time series analysis, including the evaluation and comparison of relevant algorithms.<br>

- **Lip2Wav Project**<br>Guided by Prof. Yu<br>I did the front-end interface implementation.

## Study Abroad Experiences

- Intelligent Communication Systems for Internet of Everything (Supervised by [Prof. Özgür Akan](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/oba21))

To match the ubiquitous connectivity and heterogeneous networking characteristics of the universe, IoE also integrates new IoXs into its framework. **Internet of Nano Things (IoNT)**, for example, is poised to increase the resolution of cyber-physical interfaces and bring connectivity into uncharted territories, e.g., inside the human body, with the networks of smart biological agents. **Internet of People and Senses (IoPS)**, as another example, refers to the conceptual transfer of information and even skills between humans besides the nonverbal communication of senses, e.g., olfaction and gustation. We aim to design and implement new intelligent communication techniques for the **Internet of Everything**.
